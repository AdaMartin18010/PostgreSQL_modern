Starting with a universal data model does not absolve anyone of the responsibility of knowing his or her own enterprise intimately, at even an excruciating level of detail! Nor does it absolve anyone from the responsibility of learning how to build data models!! What you have to do is start with the universal model and then, understanding data modeling and understanding your own enterprise, make the necessary modifications to make the universal model your own.",

Even if you are implementing a single application—that is, you are not attempting to build an Enterprise-wide model—you are still way ahead of the game using one of Len's models. Because his models are enterprise-wide in nature, he has already anticipated other applications' semantic requirements for the entities you are embarking on implementing. If you use his more broadly defined, enterprise-wide structures, you will save yourself the time and cost",

This can be derived from the production run model (Figure 2.12).

The quantity produced comes directly from the quantity produced attribute in the PRODUCTION RUN, and the quantity rejected comes from the PRODUCTION RUN quantity rejected attribute, which is shown in Figure 2.12, quantity rejected attribute, which is shown in Figure 2.12.",

Thus there is an important need for each carrier to store data about each other. For instance, when a customer orders local phone service, there is a need to track the long distance carrier that the customer selects. The local phone company typically bills the customer for the services of this long distance carrier, although the customer could have the long distance carrier bill for their services separately. To handle the need to maintain carrier information, there is an ORGANIZATION ROLE subtype named TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER, and there is a PARTY RELATIONSHIP OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER RELATIONSHIP that records relationships between the INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS of the enterprise and other TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. For instance, this may record the relationships of approved long distance carriers within a local exchange carrier organization.",

One can argue that the service was an examination and that the diagnosis was related to the exam.

Because diagnoses are not generally chargeable items, we will not include diagnosis as a subtype of health care offering. We will discuss diagnoses later in the health care delivery section.

An example of REQUIRED COVERAGE for car insurance is when the law requires a certain level of bodily insurance. A STANDARD COVERAGE example may be a certain level of major medical insurance that is standard but may be excluded in a health plan—for example, if someone just wants the hospitalization coverage. An OPTIONAL COVERAGE could be \"towing coverage\" for up to $200 coverage level on a car insurance product. A SELECTABLE FEATURE could be one in which the insured party needs to select among three options such as pharmaceutical coverage, nutraceutical coverage, or both pharmaceutical coverage and nutraceutical coverage (each for a certain level of coverage), assuming that one of these options needs to be picked.",

In this scenario, \"Mary Smith\" finds that she needs to alter her coverage for collision, as she feels the cost for the coverage is too high.

        "text": "The life insurance agreement is unique in that it covers loss of life. Other kinds of insurance policies will have potential losses, but life insurance involves an inevitable loss, as long as the policy is held during that loss. The key issue for life insurance agreements is when the loss will occur. This is particularly important, as certain factors influence the risk level. If the insured party is older or critically ill, the risk of the loss happening is much greater than for a healthy or younger person. The LIFE POLICY ITEM will reflect the information given to the company with regard to the risk of loss. Should the insured misrepresent his or her age or health information, the company would have the right to terminate the agreement. Usually the company will require a health assessment of the individual insured in order to protect its interests against potential fraud. These assessments require a certified medical examination usually performed by the physician employed by the insurance provider.",

In other types of insurance, typically the insured party would be the recipient of the proceeds in the event of loss. With life insurance, the insured party is the covered asset, therefore in the event of loss, the beneficiary will receive the proceeds of the agreement. This is an important section in the list of AGREEMENT TERMS for each LIFE POLICY ITEM. The beneficiary role is maintained as an AGREEMENT ROLE in Figure 5.10 insurance policy roles. Typically the beneficiary is a family member: a spouse, parent, or sibling. In the event that the insured party has no surviving family members, he or she may elect anyone to the role of beneficiary, including an organization, such as a charity or other group. Some regulatory bodies do have restrictions on this, especially where a spouse is involved. These restrictions would have to be articulated within the agreement for those conditions.",
