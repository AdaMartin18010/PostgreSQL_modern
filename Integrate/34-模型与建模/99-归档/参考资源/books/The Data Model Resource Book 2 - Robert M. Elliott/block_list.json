For example, a recursive relationship could be modeled either via a relationship pointing from an entity to itself or via a many-to-many-relationship. This depends on if it is a many-to-many recursion or a one-to-many recursion. It is possible for an entity to have many recursive relationships.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":76,"id":"b393d59f-35ad-4e65-ab57-ec3cecebe03a","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"76-2"}],[{"bbox":[75,68,422,547],"index":0,"angle":0,"type":"image","img_path":"/321c5b00d500bc41b8f82ac1a24c53d93bc9fe677f1d4c9a7a995d42a3e15e82.jpg","color":{"line":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)","fill":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)"},"img_ratio":0.5669934640522876,"page_idx":77,"id":"3c8b84c2-cc98-490a-a751-86a9b81a914e","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"77-0"},{"bbox":[73,576,253,594],"index":1,"angle":0,"type":"image_caption","text":"Figure 1.8 Exclusive arcs.","id":"b3b2344b-1d14-45e0-8415-57cb5915ab10","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":77,"page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"77-1"},{"bbox":[72,620,535,693],"index":2,"angle":0,"type":"image_caption","text":"Figure 1.9 shows an example of a one-to-many recursion around the WORK EFFORT entity to show that each WORK EFFORT may be redone via one or more WORK EFFORTs.

Each RISK ANALYSIS will have several parts to it that are called ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS. The ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS may be for an INSURANCE PRODUCT, PRODUCT FEATURE, COVERAGE TYPE, COVERAGE LEVEL, or any combination of these. The purpose of the ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS is to understand and assess factors and parameters, taking into account the potential for loss. To determine the probability of that loss, the ANALYSIS PARAMETERS—the set of factors to be considered in the event of loss—are determined and understood. Often, these are weighted in light of the coverage required and the expected loss. In the case of property and casualty insurance, the ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS may also be assessing the risk of one or more INSURED ASSET TYPE—hence, the associative relationship INSURED TARGET.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":382,"id":"ba76899f-6b67-4966-8fb0-18e3789f1a3b","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"382-0"}],[{"bbox":[75,69,537,602],"index":0,"angle":0,"type":"image","img_path":"/709fdf1ad6f6f756d52d48fb896f28634301cd1e5087df025910ed2ec1448c05.jpg","color":{"line":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)","fill":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)"},"img_ratio":0.7549019607843137,"page_idx":383,"id":"98324054-fa4b-4a4f-8034-8a4c1b7b4ff4","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"383-0"},{"bbox":[73,626,317,646],"index":1,"angle":0,"type":"image_caption","text":"Figure 5.6 Insurance underwriting.","id":"2fcef8ed-631c-48e2-ba17-11293d98cf10","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":383,"page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"383-1"},{"bbox":[73,670,517,716],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"The ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS entity may be used for two purposes: either to determine premiums for a specific policy or to determine","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":383,"id":"011b9015-7fe9-4b10-a5fe-725ac189e01c","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"383-2"}],[{"bbox":[73,76,534,174],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":0,"text":"the basis for the insurance rate tables.
