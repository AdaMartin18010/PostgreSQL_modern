It does not merely address the top levels of a data architecture (Zachman Framework row one or two); it provides both common and industry-specific logical models as well as data designs that may be customized to meet your requirements. The end result is a rich framework whose models span the higher and lower levels of a data architecture, including high-level models, logical models, warehouse designs, star schemas, and SQL scripts. You can use the data models, designs, and scripts as templates or starting points for your own modeling, an introduction to subject areas you might not be familiar with, a reference to validate your existing models, and a help to building an enterprise data architecture. The book provides techniques to transform models from one level to another, as well as tips and techniques for getting the appropriate levels of abstraction in the models. Instance tables (sample data) help bring the models to life. I have customized and used the models from the first edition on"

The use of pre-existing templates also changes the nature of the dialog between the business experts and modelers: modelers will seek to discover which model or models from their repertoire may be appropriate to the situation, then to check the detail of those models.

Each salesperson has a unique relationship to Marc and one salesperson who has sold a great deal to Marc may record a relationship status of \"very active\" while another salesperson records a status of \"inactive\" because they don't do much business for the time being. If a status attribute is related to just the contact (Marc), these sales representatives will probably override each other's information depending on their relationship and perspective. Each salesperson will also have conversations and want to record notes about their relationships, some of which may be private to their relationship. Of course, the enterprise would also want to be able to access the entire information about the \"contact\" but they should also want to maintain the unique information about each relationship.

This would be a simpler design, but it would lead to redundancy in many cases. For example, if the same party's address served as a mailing, headquarters, and service address, it would be stored as three instances in the PARTY CONTACT MECHANISM entity. Each instance would have the same party and contact mechanism id but would have a different purpose. Therefore information related to just the party and contact mechanism, such as the non-solication ind, would be repeated. In other words, the PARTY CONTACT MECHANISM entity has significance on its own and may have its own attributes or relationships, independent of the purpose(s). For this reason, our model shows separate PARTY CONTACT MECHANISM and PARTY CONTACT MECHANISM PURPOSE entities."

The status is used to indicate if the activity has been completed or if it is just scheduled. William Jones started with a face-to-face initial sales meeting on January 12 and then proceeded with a more detailed product demonstration using the company's Web site, which has the capabilities to do a product demonstration and includes chatting capabilities. The fifth entry shows an email contact initiated by John Smith to Nancy Barry who is a supplier representative. The sixth entry shows that Joe Schmoe has made a call to Jerry Red regarding a problem and illustrates that communication event tracking is important not only in sales but in other areas of the business such as purchasing relationships. This data structure provides a mechanism for tracking communication events for all types of relationships and circumstances and is a very powerful business tool."

The first call is taken on Sept 19 at 3 p.m. Jerry realized that he needs to send out a software patch so he sets up a work effort \"1029\" to make sure this gets done. On Sept 20 he follows up on this outstanding work effort and sends out the software patch with another communication effort, namely an e-mail. The example illustrates that a work effort to send a software patch in order to correct the problem may be related to two communication events; it is related to the request to send the software as well as to the communication event in which the software patch was sent. It also could have been related to follow-up calls from the customer about the sending of the patch. The third communication event shows that he followed up to make sure the patch worked and to close the case."

For instance, purchase orders hold information about the cost of the raw materials. The shipment to the customer will have freight charges, which are a cost component of the product. Time sheets and payroll records hold information about the labor costs involved in the manufacturing or delivery of products. For manufactured goods, the cost of scheduling equipment in production runs is stored in equipment assignment records. Overhead such as rent, office supplies, and other administrative goods can be factored into the product cost as well."

The advantage to using estimated costs is that product analysts can predict future trends of how much they think the product will cost instead of simply using historical information. For example, the freight charges might have historically been $1.00 from destination A to destination B. Data on current freight charges may be more appropriate for figuring out the real cost of a product. The enterprise can use the actual product costs combined with its understanding of the marketplace and future trends to enter what it believes will be the best estimate of the costs of selling its products."

Ordered features could be modeled as a recursive relationship from a feature-related ORDER ITEM to a product-related ORDER ITEM. Alternatively, ordered features could be handled by maintaining the relationships to both the ordered feature with its related product recorded in the same order item. One issue with the latter approach is that the same product may be ordered on two different order items, and each product may have a different set of features associated with it. For this reason, a recursive relationship is used, relating an order item specifying a feature to another order item for the ordered product."

With this model it is possible to then record five items of 1,000 cases each, then specify a different delivery address for each item.

This model, however, can be easily modified to provide for tracking work requirements and work efforts associated with delivery of items by creating a relationship from WORK EFFORT to SHIPMENT ITEM (work efforts will be discussed later in this chapter)."

John Smith is assigned the effort of conducting initial interviews. An outside contracting firm is allocated to the project for four months; its responsibility is to do market research. Thus the data structure allows for efforts to be completely outsourced with no internal employee actually assigned to the work, only a particular organization. In this case, the internal manager is not concerned with who does the work, only that it be well managed and tracked with this outside firm.

The benefit of this design is to be able to define a period once. For example, the fiscal from day may be \"Mar 1\" and the fiscal thru day may be \"Feb 28\" to identify a PERIOD TYPE of \"fiscal year,\" instead of having to reen-ter the accounting period for each year. One downside of this data structure is that it creates complications in handling leap years for periods ending at the end of Feb. Another downside of this data structure is that it is less practical to implement because date conversions will be needed to figure out which transactions should be posted to which periods, versus explicitly storing the dates, as shown in Figure 8.1."

With this three-part key, it is possible to record more than one person as having accepted the same position during the same time period. Of course, whether this is allowable could be controlled by implementing some business rules. If an enterprise never does job sharing, then the model could be changed to enforce this by removing the relationship to PERSON and hence removing the party ID from the compound key.

For instance, many parts of the logical data models in the prior chapters can be used by many different enterprises. The data warehouse data model is more specific to an enterprise because it is based on numerous assumptions concerning the type of decision support information that is considered useful to the enterprise. The departmental data warehouse is even more dependent on the specific needs of a department. Therefore, the data warehouse models presented later in this chapter and in subsequent chapters serve only as examples because each enterprise's data warehouse designs will be highly dependent on its own specific business needs."
