The end result is a rich framework whose models span the higher and lower levels of a data architecture, including high-level models, logical models, warehouse designs, star schemas, and SQL scripts. You can use the data models, designs, and scripts as templates or starting points for your own modeling, an introduction to subject areas you might not be familiar with, a reference to validate your existing models, and a help to building an enterprise data architecture. The book provides techniques to transform models from one level to another, as well as tips and techniques for getting the appropriate levels of abstraction in the models. Instance tables (sample data) help bring the models to life. I have customized and used the models from the first edition on",

In fact, their \"experience\" may well reside more in their personal library of models—typically remembered rather than documented—than in greater facility with the basic techniques. The use of pre-existing templates also changes the nature of the dialog between the business experts and modelers: modelers will seek to discover which model or models from their repertoire may be appropriate to the situation, then to check the detail of those models. This is a far more proactive role for modelers",

The status is used to indicate if the activity has been completed or if it is just scheduled. William Jones started with a face-to-face initial sales meeting on January 12 and then proceeded with a more detailed product demonstration using the company's Web site, which has the capabilities to do a product demonstration and includes chatting capabilities. The fifth entry shows an email contact initiated by John Smith to Nancy Barry who is a supplier representative. The sixth entry shows that Joe Schmoe has made a call to Jerry Red regarding a problem and illustrates that communication event tracking is important not only in sales but in other areas of the business such as purchasing relationships. This data structure provides a mechanism for tracking communication events for all types of relationships and circumstances and is a very powerful business tool.",

The first call is taken on Sept 19 at 3 p.m. Jerry realized that he needs to send out a software patch so he sets up a work effort \"1029\" to make sure this gets done. On Sept 20 he follows up on this outstanding work effort and sends out the software patch with another communication effort, namely an e-mail. The example illustrates that a work effort to send a software patch in order to correct the problem may be related to two communication events; it is related to the request to send the software as well as to the communication event in which the software patch was sent. It also could have been related to follow-up calls from the customer about the sending of the patch.

However, the SHIPMENT PACKAGE may exist without having a SHIPMENT RECEIPT, for instance on outgoing shipments when the organization assembles something into a package. So there is only a mandatory relationship from SHIPMENT RECEIPT to SHIPMENT PACKAGE and not vice versa. There could be many SHIPMENT RECEIPT ROLES involved in each receipt, such as the person signing for the receipt, the inspector of the goods, the person responsible for storing the receipt within inventory, the receiving manager, and the organization that is receiving the item. Each SHIPMENT RECEIPT may be verified against and applied to an ORDER ITEM to record if the receipt was what was expected. Each SHIPMENT RECEIPT may be stored in an INVENTORY ITEM, allowing these received goods' physical storage place to be recorded.",

This is a valid construct and one that is adopted within these models because order items represent commitments, including items for completing work. Both sales and purchase order items may be related to work orders, and therefore the data model would need another type of classification for PRODUCT ORDER ITEMS and WORK ORDER ITEMSs. For example, a professional services firm may record several requirements for a customer that lead to an engagement (a type of order), which is then associated with several work efforts (projects). The section on work efforts will show how to model this.",

One downside of this data structure is that it creates complications in handling leap years for periods ending at the end of Feb.

On the other hand, there may be a timing difference between the business transaction and the accounting transaction. For instance, an INVOICE may be maintained by the enterprise even though, at a particular point in time, there may not be a related accounting transaction because it has not yet been posted. Furthermore, the INVOICE may have a status of \"pending approval from manager,\" thus maintaining it as an INVOICE but not as an ACCOUNTING TRANSACTION.

If an enterprise never does job sharing, then the model could be changed to enforce this by removing the relationship to PERSON and hence removing the party ID from the compound key.
