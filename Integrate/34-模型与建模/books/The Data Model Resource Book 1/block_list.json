You can use the data models, designs, and scripts as templates or starting points for your own modeling, an introduction to subject areas you might not be familiar with, a reference to validate your existing models, and a help to building an enterprise data architecture.

The entity QUOTE stores the basic information related to the quote and is composed of QUOTE ITEMs that describe the specific PRODUCT or WORK EFFORT being quoted. QUOTE ITEMs must be related to a single REQUEST ITEM because quote items are defined as responses to these request items. Each QUOTE ITEM may, in turn, lead to one or more ORDER ITEMs because the quoted item may be ordered more than once. Similar to orders, each QUOTE or QUOTE ITEM may have terms associated with it that create the need for the relationships to QUOTE TERM and to TERM TYPE.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":271,"id":"753c9bf3-aa7d-4d71-b72b-9c4a0ab3c658","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"271-0"},{"bbox":[73,443,184,459],"angle":0,"index":1,"type":"text","text":"Figure 4.11 Quotes.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":271,"id":"517c9463-85d4-4325-8fb3-e0248e2460a3","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"271-1"}],[{"bbox":[77,69,449,521],"index":0,"angle":0,"type":"image","img_path":"/e0760035602f13df3dad8aecbe5532689bf0e4b78bd32ab3aca90314618544eb.jpg","color":{"line":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)","fill":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)"},"img_ratio":0.6078431372549019,"page_idx":272,"id":"2042b138-a8aa-4220-ad06-08c14deb97d9","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"272-0"},{"bbox":[73,555,158,574],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":1,"text":"# Quote Roles","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":272,"id":"bfab95fc-2b1c-4624-9223-b9002ebf075a","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"272-1"},{"bbox":[73,599,525,698],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"Similar to requests, two very significant relationships are explicitly stated, namely, what party issued the quote and the party to whom the quote was given.

The WORK REQUIREMENT represents the need to do something, the WORK ORDER ITEM represents the commitment to complete some work, and the WORK EFFORT entity tracks the fulfillment and performance of work that results from a WORK ORDER ITEM. There is a many-to-many relationship between each of these, allowing requirements to be flexibly combined into commitments and commitments to be grouped into manageable work efforts. The ORDER REQUIREMENT COMMITMENT associative entity was explained in Chapter 4, and the WORK ORDER ITEM FULFILLMENT associative entity is introduced in this chapter.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":352,"id":"faf10a9b-e3e6-49df-bc79-ee51e98a611b","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"352-1"},{"bbox":[73,566,259,580],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"Figure 6.3a Work effort generation.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":352,"id":"8ab0f3ba-156d-4ba8-aaa3-8cbc83094fba","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"352-2"}],[{"bbox":[78,72,438,517],"index":0,"angle":0,"type":"image","img_path":"/8582c5b9245a0bed3da7c51a70817e4ac1379f4a80f934079c8bef97543874ba.jpg","color":{"line":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)","fill":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)"},"img_ratio":0.5882352941176471,"page_idx":353,"id":"9edc44e2-55e8-46fa-a524-24c1ebc3ed7b","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"353-0"},{"bbox":[73,554,533,680],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":1,"text":"The WORK ORDER ITEM will usually result from WORK REQUIREMENTS; however, it could result from certain PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS such as for products that need to be manufactured.
