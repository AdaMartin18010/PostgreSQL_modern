# PostgreSQL CTE与递归查询完全指南

## 1. CTE基础

### 1.1 简单CTE

```sql
-- 不使用CTE
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS user_orders
WHERE order_count > 5;

-- 使用CTE（更清晰）
WITH user_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT *
FROM user_orders
WHERE order_count > 5;
```

### 1.2 多个CTE

```sql
WITH
active_users AS (
    SELECT id, username
    FROM users
    WHERE last_login > now() - INTERVAL '30 days'
),
recent_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at > now() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    u.username,
    COALESCE(o.order_count, 0) AS orders
FROM active_users u
LEFT JOIN recent_orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
ORDER BY orders DESC;
```

## 2. 递归CTE

### 2.1 组织层级

```sql
-- 组织表
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT REFERENCES employees(id),
    title VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, manager_id, title) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', NULL, 'CEO'),
(2, 'Bob', 1, 'CTO'),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 'CFO'),
(4, 'David', 2, 'Tech Lead'),
(5, 'Eve', 2, 'Senior Dev'),
(6, 'Frank', 4, 'Developer');

-- 递归查询：查找所有下属
WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
    -- 基础查询（锚点）
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, title, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE id = 2  -- Bob (CTO)

    UNION ALL

    -- 递归查询
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, e.title, s.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.id
)
SELECT
    REPEAT('  ', level - 1) || name AS org_chart,
    title,
    level
FROM subordinates
ORDER BY level, name;

/*
org_chart          | title        | level
-------------------|--------------|-------
Bob                | CTO          | 1
  David            | Tech Lead    | 2
  Eve              | Senior Dev   | 2
    Frank          | Developer    | 3
*/
```

### 2.2 路径追踪

```sql
-- 显示完整层级路径
WITH RECURSIVE org_tree AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        ARRAY[id] AS path,
        name::TEXT AS path_names,
        1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        ot.path || e.id,
        ot.path_names || ' → ' || e.name,
        ot.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_tree ot ON e.manager_id = ot.id
)
SELECT
    name,
    path_names AS hierarchy_path,
    level
FROM org_tree
ORDER BY path;

/*
name    | hierarchy_path                  | level
--------|----------------------------------|-------
Alice   | Alice                            | 1
Bob     | Alice → Bob                      | 2
David   | Alice → Bob → David              | 3
Frank   | Alice → Bob → David → Frank      | 4
Eve     | Alice → Bob → Eve                | 3
Charlie | Alice → Charlie                  | 2
*/
```

## 3. 图遍历

### 3.1 社交网络

```sql
-- 好友表
CREATE TABLE friendships (
    user1_id INT,
    user2_id INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user1_id, user2_id)
);

-- 查找所有朋友的朋友（2度连接）
WITH RECURSIVE friends_of_friends AS (
    -- 直接朋友（1度）
    SELECT
        user1_id AS source,
        user2_id AS target,
        1 AS degree,
        ARRAY[user1_id, user2_id] AS path
    FROM friendships
    WHERE user1_id = 123

    UNION

    SELECT
        user2_id,
        user1_id,
        1,
        ARRAY[user2_id, user1_id]
    FROM friendships
    WHERE user2_id = 123

    UNION ALL

    -- 朋友的朋友（2度）
    SELECT
        fof.source,
        f.user2_id,
        fof.degree + 1,
        fof.path || f.user2_id
    FROM friends_of_friends fof
    JOIN friendships f ON fof.target = f.user1_id
    WHERE fof.degree < 2
      AND NOT f.user2_id = ANY(fof.path)  -- 避免循环

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        fof.source,
        f.user1_id,
        fof.degree + 1,
        fof.path || f.user1_id
    FROM friends_of_friends fof
    JOIN friendships f ON fof.target = f.user2_id
    WHERE fof.degree < 2
      AND NOT f.user1_id = ANY(fof.path)
)
SELECT DISTINCT target AS friend_id, degree
FROM friends_of_friends
WHERE target != 123
ORDER BY degree, target;
```

### 3.2 最短路径

```sql
-- 城市路线表
CREATE TABLE routes (
    from_city VARCHAR(50),
    to_city VARCHAR(50),
    distance INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (from_city, to_city)
);

-- 查找最短路径
WITH RECURSIVE shortest_path AS (
    SELECT
        from_city,
        to_city,
        distance,
        ARRAY[from_city, to_city] AS path,
        distance AS total_distance
    FROM routes
    WHERE from_city = 'NYC'

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        sp.from_city,
        r.to_city,
        r.distance,
        sp.path || r.to_city,
        sp.total_distance + r.distance
    FROM shortest_path sp
    JOIN routes r ON sp.to_city = r.from_city
    WHERE NOT r.to_city = ANY(sp.path)  -- 避免环路
      AND sp.total_distance + r.distance < 1000  -- 剪枝
)
SELECT
    path,
    total_distance
FROM shortest_path
WHERE to_city = 'LA'
ORDER BY total_distance
LIMIT 1;

/*
path                        | total_distance
----------------------------|----------------
{NYC,Chicago,Denver,LA}     | 850
*/
```

## 4. 数列生成

### 4.1 生成序列

```sql
-- 生成1到100
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM numbers
    WHERE n < 100
)
SELECT * FROM numbers;

-- 斐波那契数列
WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci(a, b, n) AS (
    SELECT 0::BIGINT, 1::BIGINT, 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT b, a + b, n + 1
    FROM fibonacci
    WHERE n < 20
)
SELECT a AS fib_number
FROM fibonacci;

/*
fib_number
----------
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
...
*/
```

### 4.2 日期序列

```sql
-- 生成过去30天的日期
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT date - INTERVAL '1 day'
    FROM date_series
    WHERE date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT date::DATE
FROM date_series
ORDER BY date;

-- 统计每日订单（填充缺失日期）
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    SELECT '2024-01-01'::DATE AS date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT date + INTERVAL '1 day'
    FROM date_series
    WHERE date < '2024-01-31'::DATE
)
SELECT
    ds.date,
    COALESCE(COUNT(o.id), 0) AS order_count
FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.created_at::DATE = ds.date
GROUP BY ds.date
ORDER BY ds.date;
```

---

## 5. 性能优化

### 5.1 避免无限递归

```sql
-- ❌ 危险：可能无限递归
WITH RECURSIVE bad_recursion AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM bad_recursion
    -- 没有终止条件！
)
SELECT * FROM bad_recursion;

-- ✅ 安全：添加终止条件
WITH RECURSIVE safe_recursion AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM bad_recursion
    WHERE n < 1000  -- 终止条件
)
SELECT * FROM safe_recursion;

-- ✅ 配置最大递归深度
SET max_recursion_depth = 100;
```

### 5.2 优化循环检测

```sql
-- 图遍历中使用数组检测循环
WITH RECURSIVE graph_traversal AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        ARRAY[id] AS visited,
        1 AS depth
    FROM nodes
    WHERE id = 1

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.target_id,
        gt.visited || e.target_id,
        gt.depth + 1
    FROM graph_traversal gt
    JOIN edges e ON gt.id = e.source_id
    WHERE NOT e.target_id = ANY(gt.visited)  -- 关键：避免循环
      AND gt.depth < 10  -- 限制深度
)
SELECT * FROM graph_traversal;
```

## 6. 实战案例

### 6.1 物料清单（BOM）

```sql
-- 产品物料表
CREATE TABLE bill_of_materials (
    product_id INT,
    component_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, component_id)
);

-- 递归展开BOM
WITH RECURSIVE bom_explosion AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        component_id,
        quantity,
        1 AS level,
        ARRAY[product_id] AS path
    FROM bill_of_materials
    WHERE product_id = 100  -- 最终产品

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        bom.product_id,
        bom.component_id,
        bom.quantity * be.quantity,
        be.level + 1,
        be.path || bom.product_id
    FROM bom_explosion be
    JOIN bill_of_materials bom ON be.component_id = bom.product_id
    WHERE NOT bom.product_id = ANY(be.path)
)
SELECT
    component_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
    MAX(level) AS deepest_level
FROM bom_explosion
GROUP BY component_id
ORDER BY component_id;
```

### 6.2 评论回复树

```sql
-- 评论表
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT REFERENCES comments(id),
    user_id INT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- 展示评论树
WITH RECURSIVE comment_tree AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        parent_id,
        content,
        1 AS level,
        ARRAY[id] AS path,
        id::TEXT AS sort_path
    FROM comments
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        c.id,
        c.parent_id,
        c.content,
        ct.level + 1,
        ct.path || c.id,
        ct.sort_path || '-' || LPAD(c.id::TEXT, 10, '0')
    FROM comments c
    JOIN comment_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT
    REPEAT('  ', level - 1) || content AS threaded_comment,
    level
FROM comment_tree
ORDER BY sort_path;
```
